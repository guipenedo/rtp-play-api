# RTPPlay-API
RTP is the portuguese public broadcaster (Rádio e Televisão de Portugal). Their platform, RTPPlay gives free access to on demand and live tv content.

This python package uses [rtpplay's](https://www.rtp.pt/play/) mobile api to fetch their content. As opposed to web scraping, this is not expected to break too often.

*This package is in no way official nor endorsed by RTP.*

pip install rtpplayapi
